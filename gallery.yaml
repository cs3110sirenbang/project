  Our project is an OCaml library that implements a lightweight NoSQL DBMS 
  inspired by Firebase Firestore. Just like Firestore, a CamlStore database
  consists of documents, which represent data entries, and collections, which 
  are unordered collections of documents. The client would be able to create, 
  modify, and query documents and collections through a plethora of library 
  functions. The library also supports database objects, which enable 
  persistence of collections through procedural read-write access of 
  collections. The library also provides a JSON parser that allows database and 
  documents to be imported from JSON files.
