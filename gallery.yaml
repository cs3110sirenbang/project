  Our project is an OCaml library that implements a lightweight NoSQL DBMS 
  inspired by Firebase Firestore. Just like Firestore, a CamlStore database
  consists of documents, which represent data entries, and collections, which 
  are unordered collections of documents. The client would be able to create, 
  modify, and query documents and collections through a plethora of library 
  functions. The library also supports the creation of database objects which
  supports procedural read-write access of databases. The library will also 
  provide a JSON parser that allows database and documents to  be imported from 
  JSON files.
